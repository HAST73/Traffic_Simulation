<h1 align="left">Project Description</h1>

<p align="left">This project is a traffic simulation written in Java using the Swing library to create a graphical user interface. The project allows for the simulation of cars and pedestrians on a road.</p>

<h2 align="left">Features</h2>

<p align="left"> <b>Adding Vehicles:</b> The user can add different types of cars (e.g., SUV, Semi, SportsCar) to the road, both in the upper and lower parts of the screen.
  
<b>Adding Pedestrians</b> The user can add pedestrians who move across crosswalks.

<b>Start/Stop Simulation</b> The ability to start and stop the traffic simulation.

<b>Collisions</b> The simulation detects collisions between vehicles and between vehicles and pedestrians, stopping their movement if a collision occurs.

<b>Movement Animation</b> Vehicles move along the road, changing lanes when encountering obstacles.

<b>Graphical Interface</b> The graphical user interface allows interaction with the simulation through buttons.</p>
